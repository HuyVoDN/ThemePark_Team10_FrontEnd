Create
    [DONE]Login page for all Roles
    [DONE]Registration Page for all roles
    Create main Admin page, using it to add/view managers informations, manage prices, manage mantainances, view reports of sales.
    Create Manager page, using it to add/view customer tickets/informations, manage workers, manages sales manually, managers can change their passwords, emails manually on page.
    [MAJOR] When clicks on the View button, it generates the details of the current tab, then from there you have other buttons to modify the values of the current tab. Let's say that you click on the Tickets Tab, then click on the View Tickets. It will provide you with the current list of tickets, from there, you would have a button allowing you to modify the values of that ticket.
Add User Roles
    Manager: login, edit customers profiles, update customer tickets, logout.
    Admin: login, edit workers profiles, adjust prices, adjust attraction values ( such as names, prices, mantainance dates), view reports, logout.
Reports Page
    Accessible only through Admin, probably use a CREATE VIEW function to create view of each attributes from tables.

<optional> Forgot Password
    Though not a necessity, but it would be pretty cool if I could implement this.
        The way it resets password is that, the user will input its username, then it will hook up with the database from the web app, search for the username.
        If found, it will automatically delete the current password, and puke out the new random generated password for the user. If not found, returns "username doesn't exist".
